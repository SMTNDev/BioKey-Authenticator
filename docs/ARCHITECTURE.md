# **BioKey Authenticator - System Architecture**

The architecture of **BioKey Authenticator** is designed to provide a highly secure, scalable, and efficient solution for biometric authentication and session management on Termux. The system relies on several key components: biometric security, encryption, user profile management, and session control. The following sections describe the core architecture, including the overall system flow and the interaction between components.


## **1. Overview**

The **BioKey Authenticator** system follows a modular design pattern, with each core module responsible for a specific task:

- **Biometric Authentication**: Handles biometric device interactions for user authentication.
- **Encryption**: Ensures data security using AES-256 encryption.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, locking/unlocking based on activity.
- **User Profile Management**: Manages the storage and retrieval of user profiles with encryption.

The application follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture with additional layers for encryption and session management.


## **2. High-Level Architecture**

The high-level architecture is composed of the following layers:

1. **UI Layer (CLI)**  
   The user interface is provided through a command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with the core modules. This layer receives user input and displays results.

2. **Application Layer (Core)**  
   Contains the core logic for authentication, encryption, session management, and user profile handling. This layer processes data received from the UI and performs business logic.

3. **Data Layer**  
   The data layer includes secure storage for user profiles and logs, typically using **SQLite** with AES-256 encryption for secure data storage.

4. **Security Layer**  
   This layer handles biometric authentication, encryption, and decryption functions. It is responsible for ensuring that all sensitive data is securely stored and transmitted.


## **3. Detailed Component Breakdown**

### **3.1. Authentication Module**

- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication using device biometrics (fingerprint/face recognition).
- **Key Components**:
  - `biometric_auth.py`: Interfaces with platform-specific APIs to authenticate users.
  - **Workflow**:
    - The `authenticate_user()` function prompts for biometric input.
    - If successful, the system proceeds to the next step in the workflow. If unsuccessful, it returns to the authentication prompt.
  
**Flow**:
1. User launches the application.
2. The system checks if biometric authentication is supported.
3. If supported, the user is prompted to authenticate.
4. Upon successful authentication, the system proceeds to the next stage.

### **3.2. Encryption Module**

- **Purpose**: Provides AES-256 encryption and decryption for securing sensitive data.
- **Key Components**:
  - `encryption.py`: Encrypts user data, session information, and logs using AES-256.
  - **Workflow**:
    - User data is encrypted before storage.
    - Sensitive data is decrypted when needed for display or processing.

**Flow**:
1. Data is collected (e.g., user information).
2. The data is encrypted using a unique key before being stored.
3. When needed, the data is decrypted for use.

### **3.3. Session Management Module**

- **Purpose**: Manages user sessions to lock and unlock access based on activity.
- **Key Components**:
  - `session_manager.py`: Manages the start, end, and lock/unlock of sessions.
  - **Workflow**:
    - A session starts after successful authentication.
    - The session is locked after a period of inactivity.
    - The session is unlocked upon re-authentication.

**Flow**:
1. The session is started upon successful user authentication.
2. User activities are logged, and the session is maintained.
3. If there is inactivity, the session is automatically locked.
4. The session can be unlocked with re-authentication.

### **3.4. User Profile Management Module**

- **Purpose**: Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of user profiles.
- **Key Components**:
  - `user_profile.py`: Handles profile creation, retrieval, and management.
  - **Workflow**:
    - Profiles are encrypted before storage.
    - When required, the profiles are decrypted for retrieval and display.

**Flow**:
1. When a user signs in for the first time, a new profile is created.
2. The profile is encrypted and saved in the storage.
3. When the user logs in again, the system retrieves the profile, decrypts it, and loads the user data.


## **4. Data Flow**

1. **User Input**: The user interacts with the CLI by entering commands for authentication, profile management, or session control.
2. **Authentication**: The system checks if biometric authentication is available. If so, it prompts the user for biometric input.
3. **Profile Management**: Upon successful authentication, the user profile is either created or retrieved. The profile data is encrypted and stored securely.
4. **Session Management**: After profile management, a user session is started, and the system monitors activity to lock/unlock the session based on user input and inactivity.
5. **Data Storage**: All sensitive data, such as user profiles and session logs, are stored in an encrypted SQLite database.


## **5. Technologies and Tools**

- **Python 3.8+**: The core language used to develop the application.
- **Termux**: The terminal-based environment for running the application.
- **SQLite**: Used for secure, local storage of user profiles and data.
- **AES-256**: The encryption standard used to ensure data security.
- **Biometric APIs**: Platform-specific APIs used for fingerprint or facial recognition (depending on the device).
- **pip**: Python package manager used for dependency management.


## **6. Security Considerations**

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data, including user profiles and session information, are encrypted using AES-256 to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Biometric Authentication**: Biometric data is never stored; instead, the system uses a token or hash from the biometric data to verify identity securely.
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on the device to ensure privacy. No data is shared with external servers.


## **7. Scalability and Future Improvements**

The **BioKey Authenticator** is designed to be easily scalable:
- **Multi-user support**: The system can be extended to handle multiple users by creating separate encrypted profiles for each user.
- **Cloud Sync (Future)**: Support for securely syncing user profiles across devices (optional feature).
- **Modular Extension**: Additional features like voice recognition or 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) can be integrated easily without major changes to the core architecture.


## **8. Conclusion**

The architecture of **BioKey Authenticator** is built to be secure, modular, and scalable. It ensures a high level of privacy and security by integrating biometric authentication, AES-256 encryption, and efficient session management. With a clean, modular design, the system is adaptable and ready for future enhancements.
